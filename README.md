## features

### info bar

Browsing to pages from reddit or clicking on the alien icon in the location bar opens an information bar at the top of the page. The bar shows the current score and title of the page submission on reddit and makes it easy to vote, save the post, and view comments.

### submit bar

Clicking on the alien icon in the location bar opens a submit bar if the page is not already submitted to reddit. The submit bar allows users to craft a title for the reddit submission without leaving the page. Clicking submit opens the reddit submit page with the title filled in.
